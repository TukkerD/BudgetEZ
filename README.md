# Overview

{I made this program to better understand SQL in the form of SQLite/Python integration.}

{The software I made is a simple finance tracker. This is using a finance SQLite database with tables of expenses and income.}

# Relational Database

{The database I am using is a SQLite database named finances.}

{The table has two tables, income and expenses. Income has two categories: Month and Pay. Expenses has 7: Month, Rent, Gas, Groceries, Tithing, Car, and Misc

# Development Environment

{I used PyCharm as my preferred IED for python and most of the SQLite coding. I also used SQLite Studio to check the tables.}

# Future Work

* Flush out the rest of the months
* Make a GUI rather than using the python console
